# FFXIV-HighLow-Console
Play the "High or Low" minigame from the comfort of your own terminal

## Requirements
- Requires JDK 23
- Windows cmd does not support coloured text by default, resulting in weird text in the terminal.
  -   Either use the new Terminal app, or edit the registry to enable it.

 ## Instructions 
Download the jar from the Releases page and run the file with `java -jar HighOrLow.jar` in the terminal.

I take no responsibility for any gambling problems caused or exacerbated by this program.
